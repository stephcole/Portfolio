# HTML and CSS Projects
 In the HTML/CSS course I have completed various projects including, but not limited to:
 1. Space Station Webpage: this assignment had me utilize both html and css to create an interactive webpage. The page consisted of a variety of photos that included descriptions, groupings, and hover effects.
 2. One Page Project: This page includes links to different areas of the page, a contact form, as well as a video.
 3. Bootstrap Project: This was the first time I utilized bootstrap code in order to create various webpage structures. This included columns, banners, links, and other containers.
 4. Portfolio: Completing my HTML and CSS course involved creating a
 dynamic webpage, utilizing all of the codes I had previously incorporated. My portfolio page consists of a video, various images, links, columns, and contact information. I look forward to expanding on this with future courses.
